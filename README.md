# Smart Restaurant Management System - 

# Technologies used
Android application which uses Python Django framework at the server side.

# What is it about?

The motivation is to develop a smart application which automates the ordering and billing procedures in a restaurant while offering a great 'get suggestions' feature. The suggestions would be based on previous orders by the user, taking into account the user's likes/dislikes, health, restaurant's specialities etc.

# How to use it?

The application has both a server side and a client side. The client side operates on Android platform and the server side is hosted online and it uses Python-Django framework. Both of them are provided in the repository and they can be used for distribution.
